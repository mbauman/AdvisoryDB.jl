libcurl's ASN1 parser code has the `GTime2str()` function, used for parsing an
ASN.1 Generalized Time field. If given an syntactically incorrect field, the
parser might end up using -1 for the length of the *time fraction*, leading to
a `strlen()` getting performed on a pointer to a heap buffer area that is not
(purposely) null terminated.

This flaw most likely leads to a crash, but can also lead to heap contents
getting returned to the application when
[CURLINFO_CERTINFO](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLINFO_CERTINFO.html) is used.

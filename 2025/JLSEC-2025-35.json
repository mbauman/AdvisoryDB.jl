    "details": "This flaw allows an attacker to insert cookies at will into a running program\nusing libcurl, if the specific series of conditions are met.\n\nlibcurl performs transfers. In its API, an application creates \"easy handles\"\nthat are the individual handles for single transfers.\n\nlibcurl provides a function call that duplicates en easy handle called\n[curl_easy_duphandle](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_duphandle.html).\n\nIf a transfer has cookies enabled when the handle is duplicated, the\ncookie-enable state is also cloned - but without cloning the actual\ncookies. If the source handle did not read any cookies from a specific file on\ndisk, the cloned version of the handle would instead store the file name as\n`none` (using the four ASCII letters, no quotes).\n\nSubsequent use of the cloned handle that does not explicitly set a source to\nload cookies from would then inadvertently load cookies from a file named\n`none` - if such a file exists and is readable in the current directory of the\nprogram using libcurl. And if using the correct file format of course.",
